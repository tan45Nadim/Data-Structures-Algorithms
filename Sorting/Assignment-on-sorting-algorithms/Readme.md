# Performance Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 

--------
In this assignment, you will compare the performance of three sorting algorithms based on different datasets. You must follow the following procedures. 

1. Create at least 4 datasets of different sizes. One of the dataset must contain at least 100,000 values. 

2. Implement the Bubble, Selection and Insertion sort algorithms.

3. Execute these algorithms on all datasets and measure their performance in terms of execution time, number of comparisons and number of swaps (exchanges).
